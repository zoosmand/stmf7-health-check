# Development rules

This document defines the contribution workflow for project-owned firmware,
documentation, build configuration, and tests. It applies to maintainers,
contributors, and automated coding assistants.

## Issue-first development

Every functional change, correction, or substantial refactor starts with a
GitHub issue. The issue must describe:

- the problem or goal;
- the intended scope;
- important constraints and exclusions;
- acceptance and verification criteria;
- known follow-up work that is deliberately deferred.

Add a readable issue comment when implementation begins or when a design
decision materially changes the scope. Do not expose passwords, tokens,
private keys, or other credentials in issues or comments.

Small documentation-only changes may be committed directly to `dev` only when
the maintainer explicitly authorizes it.

## Branches

Create the implementation branch from an up-to-date `dev` branch. Its name
must use the corresponding issue number:

```text
issue-<number>
```

For example, issue 10 is implemented in `issue-10`.

Do not mix unrelated work into an issue branch. If local work was started on
the wrong branch, preserve tracked and untracked files with a named stash,
create the correct branch, and pop the stash there. Resolve any conflicts
before continuing.

## Code and documentation

- Follow [the project naming conventions](NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md).
- Keep imported vendor and middleware code in its upstream style.
- Preserve the established ownership of `Core`, `Periph`, `Srv`, `lwip`, and
  the future `TLS` tree.
- Document public interfaces, structures, units, blocking behavior, ownership,
  and task or interrupt restrictions where relevant.
- Keep comments focused on design intent, hardware constraints, and non-obvious
  behavior.
- Update the README or focused documentation whenever externally visible
  behavior, setup, commands, diagnostics, or dependencies change.
- Do not delete unused vendor source trees merely to reduce the build. Control
  compiled sources through the Makefile.

Third-party source trees excluded by `.gitignore` must be installed according
to [the ignored-source instructions](IGNORED_SOURCES.md).

## Local and generated files

The `.vscode/` configuration belongs to the maintainer. Contributors must ask
before changing any file inside it, even when an editor suggests an automatic
update.

Do not commit:

- build products or logs;
- editor, assistant, or machine-specific configuration;
- plaintext passwords, bearer tokens, private keys, or certificates containing
  private keys;
- generated files that embed secrets;
- unrelated local changes.

A generated password verifier, public certificate, salt, or other non-secret
configuration may be committed when the design explicitly requires it. Verify
that no plaintext source credential is present before committing.

## Verification

Before requesting review:

1. Inspect the complete diff and confirm that it contains only issue-related
   changes.
2. Run `git diff --check`.
3. Perform a clean firmware build using the repository Makefile.
4. Review compiler and linker warnings rather than dismissing them
   automatically.
5. Record Flash, DTCM, SRAM, and dedicated DMA-memory changes when material.
6. Run available host-side tests and static checks.
7. Test on the target device when hardware behavior is affected.

The maintainer performs final target-device checks unless they explicitly
delegate them. Do not report hardware verification unless it actually ran.
Non-critical vendor-library warnings may be accepted only after their impact
has been reviewed and documented.

## Commits and publication

- Do not commit or push until the maintainer requests it.
- Use a concise imperative commit subject describing the outcome.
- Keep commits scoped to the issue.
- Never rewrite shared history without explicit approval.
- Publish only the current issue branch unless direct `dev` publication was
  explicitly authorized.

## Pull requests

Open the pull request from `issue-<number>` into `dev`. Its description or first
comment should summarize:

- the implemented behavior;
- important design decisions;
- verification performed;
- memory impact when relevant;
- known limitations and deferred work;
- the corresponding issue.

Read every review finding and verify it against the current code. Fix findings
that affect correctness, security, reliability, maintainability, or meaningful
resource usage. If a recommendation should not be implemented, explain the
technical reason clearly in the pull request rather than silently ignoring it.

After changes, commit and push them only when requested, then add a readable PR
comment describing what changed and how it was verified.

## Merge and cleanup

Merge only after review approval and successful required testing. Use the merge
method requested by the maintainer.

After a successful merge:

1. Comment the corresponding issue with the final result.
2. Close the issue when all accepted scope is complete.
3. Delete the issue branch when requested.
4. Return to `dev`.
5. Pull the merged `dev` branch.

Do not close an issue when required work remains. Record deferred work in a new
issue or explicitly document it as an accepted limitation.
